## Overview

A topological sorting-based solution for project scheduling using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Implements PERT/CPM methodologies to calculate:

- Earliest start/finish times (forward pass)
- Latest start/finish times (backward pass)
- Total float/slack time

## 👨‍💻 Role

**Lead Developer**

## ❓ Problem

1. Task dependencies created non-trivial scheduling constraints
2. Manual critical path identification proved error-prone for large projects (n > 100 tasks)
3. Schedule not optimally formatted in relation to time effeciency.

---

## 🎯 Goal

1. Develop O(n) algorithm for critical path identification
2. Model both AND/OR task dependencies
3. Achieve 95% accuracy vs. ground truth schedules

## ✨ Solution

### Graph Representation

- Designed adjacency list structure with edge weights for task durations
- Implemented topological sort using Kahn's algorithm (indegree counting)

### PERT Implementation

- Calculated expected time for stochastic tasks
- Performed forward/backward passes with memoization for O(n) efficiency

### Critical Path Analysis

- Identified zero-slack tasks constituting critical path
- Determine optimal task to perform
