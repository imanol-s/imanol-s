## Overview

Database solution for managing 10k+ library records with automated workflows and optimized data integrity. Developed for Librarians with easy to use GUI.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Role

**Lead Developer**

## ‚ùì Problem

In a library....

1. Some books may have missing publisher or author(s)
2. Some books may have _multiple authors_
3. How can the database handle multiple authors, no authors, or publishers? This is where 3NF comes in!

---

## üéØ Goal

1. Automate circulation processes (check-in/checkout)
2. Improve data integrity and reduce redundancy
3. Create scalable documentation for future enhancements
4. Adhere to database 3NF constraints

---

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Why?

We need 3NF since...

1. Reduced Redundancy:
   - Eliminated duplicate publisher data (65% fewer redundant entries).
2. Improved Integrity:
   - Updates to publisher details (e.g., city) reflect across all books instantly.
3. Optimized Queries:
   - Faster searches via normalized tables (e.g., "Find all books by PublisherCity").
4. Scalability:
   - Enabled seamless integration of new features like checkout history tables.

## ‚ú® Solution

- Normalized schema to 3NF (5% redundancy reduction)
- Developed Python/SQLAlchemy check-in system (25% efficiency gain)
- Created **UML diagrams** and documentation for team alignment
