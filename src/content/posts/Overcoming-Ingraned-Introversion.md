# Introversion

For most of my life, I identified as an introvert. I preferred quiet environments, deep one-on-one conversations, and often felt drained after extended social interaction. While these traits served me well in academic settings, the transition into a corporate environment challenged me in unexpected ways—which I accepted with open arms.

Introverts who want to speak up often experience a kind of internal tug-of-war: they rehearse what they want to say in their head, wait for the “right” moment to jump in, and sometimes overanalyze how their words might be received. This hesitation can lead to missed opportunities—not because they lack ideas, but because *the friction between thought and expression is real*.

## The Reality

In the workplace, communication is currency. Meetings, presentations, networking events, and impromptu hallway conversations are not just social niceties—they're opportunities for visibility, influence, and growth. Early in my internship, I realized that staying silent—even when I had a want to meet new colleagues meant missing out on those opportunities and connections.

> Introversion isn’t a weakness—it’s a trait. But like any trait, it can be adapted to fit the environment you’re in.

As a Computer Science major, I was well aware that technical skills often take center stage in our field—but communication is what amplifies impact. Knowing that many CS students (myself included) don’t naturally gravitate toward public speaking or group discussions only increased my motivation to improve.


## Small Shifts, Big Impact

Small, intentional shifts:

- **Prepared Participation**: I started preparing talking points before meetings to feel more confident speaking up. This would include taking notes, transcribing meetings, and tracking domain conversations.
- **One-on-One Connections**: I am working on a short one-on-one chats with my manager to build rapport in a low-pressure setting. Being clear and concicse about my personal goals vertically align my experience directly.
- **Visible Wins**: I shared and asked for reccomendations on improving my communication style.

## Embracing Discomfort

Growth rarely happens in comfort zones. I volunteered to lead a sprint retrospective. I asked a question during an all-hands meeting. I even gave a short presentation on a data migration process I helped support. Each moment felt uncomfortable—but each one built confidence.

## What I Learned

- **Introversion is not a barrier**—but it does require strategy in environments that reward extroverted behaviors. Removing the fricton takes conscious effort.
- **Empathy is a strength**—it helped me listen deeply, understand team dynamics, and lead with intention.
- **Visibility matters**—not for ego, but for impact.

## Final Thoughts

If you're an introvert navigating a corporate world, know this: you don’t have to become someone else. You just have to stretch. A little discomfort today can lead to a lot of growth tomorrow. And if you're like me a little guidance from a mentor or two never hurts. I’m immensely grateful for the opportunity to work alongside seasoned professionals who help bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.

Special thanks to K.D. and B.W. for their guidance, support, and the example they set every day.
