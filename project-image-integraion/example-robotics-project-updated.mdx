## Challenges and Learnings

- **Reward Function Design:** Balancing multiple objectives (edge-following accuracy, speed, stability) in reward structure required careful tuning
- **Sim-to-Real Gap:** Understanding challenges of transferring learned behaviors from simulation to physical robots
- **Performance Evaluation:** Learned to analyze RL training curves and identify issues like reward hacking or unstable learning
- **Technical Communication:** Developed skills in documenting complex ML systems for technical and non-technical audiences
