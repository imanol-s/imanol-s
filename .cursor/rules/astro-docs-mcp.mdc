# Astro Docs MCP

An MCP server named **Astro docs** is available in this workspace.

When working with `.astro` files or Astro configuration (`astro.config.mjs`), use the **Astro docs** MCP server to look up:

- Astro API references and built-in components
- Configuration options and integration setup
- Content collections API and schema definitions
- Routing, layouts, and page patterns
- View transitions and client directives

Prefer the MCP server over web search or guessing for any Astro-specific question.
